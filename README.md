# MCNSAChat2
---
**MCNSAChat2** is the rebirth of the MCNSAChat plugin that has helped [mcnsa](http://mcnsa.com) manage chat for the last half a year. There were a few problems with the old chat - it used old permissions, the code was horribly sloppy, it was somewhat inefficient, etc. This version seeks to fix all those problems and introduce some new functionality that will keep our server running happily for the foreseeable future.

## Configuration
---
Here is the default configuration file:

	# local-chat-radius: radius of local chat channel (in blocks)
	# default-channel: default chat channel that new users will join
	# default-colour: default new channel colour
	# announce-timeouts: announce timeouts to the entire server?
	# chat-format: the format chat will be printed in
	# emote-format: the format emotes will be printed in
	# 	** for the above 2, use the following substitutions:
	#		%channel	the players channel
	#		%prefix		the players prefix (from PermissionsEx)
	#		%suffix		the players suffix (from PermissionsEx)
	#		%player		the players name
	#		%message	the message
	# spam:
	#     limit: number of messages sent
	#     period: within the given time period
	# hard channels
	#	channel name:
	#		colour: <colour name>
	#		alias: <alias> (for example, alias = "g", type "/g" to switch to channel G
	#		local: <true/false> (optional)
	#		broadcast: <true/false> (optional)
	#		permission: <permission node> permission node to get into the channel (optional)
	#						final permission string will be: "mcnsachat2.channel.<permission node>"
	#		listeners: <permission node> permission node to automatically listen in on the channel (optional)
	#						final permission string will be: "mcnsachat2.listen.<permission node>"
