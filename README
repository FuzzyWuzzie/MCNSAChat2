MCNSAChat is the second coming of MCNSAChat. It is being re-written to be better,
more efficient, and provide multiworld support and modern-day permissions.

Some new features could potentially include:
	- Per-user suppression of various messages (including notifications from
	other plugins)
	- '*' user selections (for example, to move all users to 'G' with a
	single command)
